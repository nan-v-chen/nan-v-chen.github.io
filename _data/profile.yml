    I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/" target="_blank">University of Twente</a> in the Netherlands, under the supervision of <a href="https://doina.net/" target="_blank">Dr. Doina  Bucur</a> and <a href="https://personen.utwente.nl/m.vankeulen" target="_blank">Prof. Maurice van Keulen</a>.
    Before joining UT, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://ir.baidu.com/" target="_blank">Baidu, Inc.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests lie in the fields of network data science and machine learning.
    I previously worked on brain networks, but now I am shifting to microbial and ecological networks.
    I specialize in network structure inference, network classification, dynamic/multimodal network analysis, causal inference, and further practical applications based on networks.
